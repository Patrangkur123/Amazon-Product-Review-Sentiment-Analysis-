The camera is okay and I love the edit features you can do to the pictures.  Amazon/Netflix/Huliu all run smoothly on this tablet. The internet runs a lot faster than our other tablet too.  While over all I am happy with this tablet it did come with a couple disappointments that I wanted to make sure other people are aware of.  I am an Amazon Prime member and I thought that with Amazon Prime you could read a lot of books for free with a kindle and was disappointed to see you can only borrow one kindle book a month for free. :(  Also one of the main reasons we purchased  a tablet was because my kids love the Plants vs Zombies games.  The kids were quite disappointed that Plants vs Zombies 2 is not available for the fire.  There are also other games/apps that we were looking forward to using that are not available on the Fire that were available for our previous cheaper Neutab tablet that we were looking forward to using on this tablet.  I recommend people ask about apps they are looking forward to using before buying.,31-08-2015,1

I was once given a ProntoTec 7&#34; tablet and it was so useless, I was put off on tablets altogether. But the Kindle Fire actually works, and works well. It's quick, responds accurately to my touch, and makes an excellent Kindle ebook reader. I've been reading like crazy since I got it. It also performs fine for simple things like checking email and getting notices from my gmail calendar. For other uses, like games, or anything that involves text input, I'd rather be at my desktop with a big screen and good keyboard. That's not a knock on the Fire, it's just my preference. The point is that I haven't been downloading apps and using them. Other than sitting in my easy chair and reading, I can't think of anything I'd rather do on a tablet than on a desktop PC.<br /><br />I once read that Amazon sells the Kindles at below cost in the hope the buyers will spend money on the books, movies, videos, subscription services, etc. I don't know if that is true, but really, a tablet isn't of any value without the content, so any review of the Kindle Fire must address that. I have enjoyed my free trials of both Amazon Prime and Kindle Unlimited (KU). Both are paid services that give you privileges and &#34;free&#34; stuff (that you are paying for with your subscription). I have decided to cancel both at the end of the free trial period next week. I'm not saying they aren't worth it. I've found a couple of good TV series on Amazon Prime (Bosch, Sneaky Pete) and read some good books from KU. But after checking my reading wish list against the KU offerings, I find that most of them are available on Kindle for money, but are not in the KU or Prime catalog. So I would still have to pay for them. Similarly, the best movies on Amazon video are not included in Prime. So despite paying for these free downloads and streams through the subscription, I'd still pay full retail on top of that. I don't see the point of the subscriptionif that holds true. I've downloaded the Overdrive app so I can get some of these ebooks from my local library. I'll try that for awhile. I'll also check out the free books that are always being offered on Amazon and see how good or bad they are. I may go back to KU after I've compared that experience. And I may just start buying Kindle books without the subscriptions services. I really like the Kindle for book reading.<br /><br />Your needs and tastes may vary. I just urge you to consider how you're going to use the Kindle. The Fire does not allow access to the Google app store downloads. You have to get your apps from Amazon's store. Many are free, but you can't necessarily get the ones you would like that are available for Android phones and tablets. Also, this model is wi-fi only, so it's not connected using the cell service data plans. That works for me because I don't take it out of the house, but you may want to spring for something more expensive if you need to be always connected.",30-08-2015,1

In all that time the only problem I ever had was with the charger, which did not work unless I had it plugged in at a very specific angle. I called tech support and they sent me a new charger, free of charge, just to make sure it was the charger and not the device. The woman I spoke to was very helpful and it turned out the new charger worked fine so the original charger was defective, not my Kindle. Both my son and I loved playing games and reading books on the Kindle Fire and occasionally watching videos we downloaded. We used it on a daily basis and I was very sad when I broke it. I had taken it to an eye doctor appointment so I could read while I waited and that is where the accident happened. As I rolled the chair over to the glaucoma testing machine, my Kindle flew out of my lap and slammed into the metal base of the machine...I guess I was rolling a little too enthusiastically. The device appeared to be fine, the screen didn't even have a scratch on it, but when I turned it on all I had was a half blue/half black screen. I haven't called tech support because it was a great excuse for me to get the new, larger Kindle Fire I had been thinking about buying anyway. I don't understand the negative reviews of this product at all; if my Kindle can slam into the metal base of a machine and not break the screen, I have a hard time believing falling three feet on to grass or off the arm of the living room chair can break the screen. I suspect  the negative reviews are exaggerated by people upset at their own or their kid's clumsiness.

The tablet is nice looking and has an exceptionally vibrant screen.  I read comments about the OS not being a &#34;real&#34; Andriod, but I've been able to load(or side load) all of the apps I've been using on my iPhone. The only app I haven't managed to install that had caused some issues has been Google Play. A couple of the side loaded Google apps say they need it, but then the continue to function as normal. I'm not sure why Amazon doesn't allow the loading of the Google apps, just to make the customer's life easier.  The tablet speed is quite adequate about 98% of the time, but on rare occasion things sort of stop, then catch back up.<br /><br />A couple of complaints.  I've only been using the Fire for roughly two weeks, but it does not seem to have overwhelming battery life.  If I use it a lot I would probably charge it daily.  One of the reasons I was replacing my Nook Color was that I had to charge it every 4 days. That's not a completely fair comparison as I'm doing much more on the Fire, but I had hoped the battery would last longer. I've installed utilities to give me some visibility into battery usage, but there doesn't seem to be much I can do to help other than possibly turn off the Wifi some, but that's not why you buy a tablet is it?<br /><br />Second complaint is about accessories.  I guess there is confusion about the various versions that are in some way a Kindle Fire 7, but not the HD 4th generation. I had a hard time finding a case locally, other than the odd one sold by Amazon, or generic cases with hooks on the side.  I ordered one from Amazon.com that was supposed to work, but turns out even though it said it was for my machine it really wasn't. I finally found a non-Prime seller that has a good, reasonable priced case, it just took a while. And unlike anything starting with an &#34;i&#34; or a Galaxy, it is hard to find accessories locally, and I live in a big town.<br /><br />I purchasedit on &#34;Prime Day&#34; for $79, and at that price the Fire 7 HD is an exceptional value.  Would I feel the same had I paid $139? I'm not sure. At full price I probably would have purchased the Nook Galaxy Note Tab 7, primarily because it has an SD slot.",26-08-2015,1

Before the update it would automatically load whichever profile was loaded when it shut down.  This change is causing a good deal of frustration with the toddler who used to be able to power it on and get into his profile with very little assistance.<br />Also, I purchased the full version of some preschool apps, but they cannot be used in the child's profile because it does not allow for in-app purchases.  While Amazon was willing to refund my money for the apps, their first response was to allow the child to use the apps in the parent's profile.  I felt that defeated the purpose of parental controls.  My husband and I use a Samsung tablet.  When we upgrade our tablet we're going to give our old one to the kids because the Samsung Kid's Mode app is more user-friendly--it allows in-app purchases to be used in Kid's mode and if the tablet shuts down in kid's mode, it reboots in kid's mode.",25-08-2015,0

I won't go into details, but it was an all around disappointing experience. I replaced it with an Asus tablet and a Kindle Paper white, both of which I continue to use today. I still had a technological hole in my heart,  wanting a smaller, more portable tablet to read ePub books and for light surfing, Facebook and Pinterest. I purchased the HD 7 during the July 2015 sale, and for a tablet? I consider it a steel.<br /><br />Pros: Great picture, intuitive set up, performs well during regular use, light surfing, and streaming video, provides me a smaller, lighter tablet for reading ePub books, easy to switch between applications.<br /><br />Cons:  The battery life is just OK. Limited applications - they still make it difficult to load android apps that aren't specifically marketed through Amazon. Shopping on Amazon using Silk and the 7&#34; screen is not easy.  I usually revert back to my Asus tablet or a PC. It's a bit heavy to carry around in a purse.<br /><br />In closure: it is a great little device for the money, but until it can fully integrate with the rest of the android world (play store), it will be relegated to reading and light surfing.",23-08-2015,1

Coming from iOS, some of the displays aren't intuitive, like the home screen that shows only some of the apps unless you select one of the categories from the top and the carousel, which I believe shows you the most recent used apps but shows me books, too. I wish there was a way to categorize apps within the home screen, because it's quite messy. Silk is not my favorite browser, and I don't like how I have to go to the homes screen to check something on another app (i.e- Goodreads) and then have to return to Silk to search, if that makes sense.

I bought it to replace a Nexus 7 (original gen) that was getting on in years.  That was a mistake.  The Fire HD 7, while providing a nice screen, is very frustrating to deal with when you're coming from a more versatile system.  To be clear, the only things I really do on these devices is: 1) read books; 2) watch movies/shows on channel specific or general apps like Hulu, Netflix, Showtime, etc.; 3) occasionally browse the web; and 4) occasionally play games.  For these simple purposes, the Fire is okay, but barely.  Because it's a closed system, you can only download apps from Amazon, who doesn't have the full complement of apps available on Google Play.  You can root the Fire, but that's way more work than should be necessary for something like this.<br /><br />Then there's the battery life, which is horrible.  I now rarely use the Fire because it always needs to be charged.  I can have it fully charged, read something on it for 30 minutes, put it down for a day, and come back to find it's out of juice.  My old Nexus 7 doesn't even eat battery like that!  That makes this thing an occasional device to use after my Nexus runs down.  Added to that, despite its use of the universal Micro USB, it only seems to charge on its own cord, which makes meet think it's poorly constructed to boot.<br /><br />Bottom line: I regret wasting my money on this and will not be buying again, or recommending to anyone else to purchase unless it's super cheap.",20-08-2015,0

The screen cracked today. I called into Amazon, and was told that they would not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. I asked them why does the commercial say that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, but not a drop of less than 2 feet. When I told the representative, Melissa, that, she got smart with me. I asked to speak to her manager, and she said that she could not contact a manager, but she could contact a supervisor. (Same thing.) When the manager, Ryan, got on the phone, he apologized that my screen was cracked, but he would still not replace or fix my Kindle Fire. We asked for his supervisor, and were told Jeff Bezos, but they had no way of contacting him. I've had this Kindle Fire for less than a year. This is the first thing to happen to it. I do not believe that they should state that the Kindle Fire can withstand G-Forces, when obviously it cannot. I am very disappointed not only with Amazon's response, but with the attitude of the phone representatives. I was never informed that there was an accident insurance plan, but I wouldn't have been, since they are all third party.

I have Comcast mail and even though I set it up to delete my mail from the server when I delete the mail on the Fire this doesn't work on any level. Also, even after I download my mail to my laptop (which then deletes the mail on the server), the mail is still on the Fire and it doesn't have the option of deleting all the mail, which makes it a pain to have to go in and check each email individually in order to delete them from the inbox. If these improvements were made, or the Xfinity mail app was available on the Fire, I would change my rating, but I don't see that happening any time soon.<br /><br />Overall, the screen resolution is more than adequate and now that I've used it for a little over a week, I'm getting used to it's idiosyncrasies and liking it a bit more, but it will never replace my iPad.

Logging on from the lock screen is also sluggish where after i put in my pass pin there is a good 1 second lag where i am often unsure if there was an &#34;enter&#34; or &#34;ok&#34; button i forgot to press. Performance within apps are no problem, once an app is loaded it runs smoothly from books, to games, to movies.<br /><br />-Battery: (Fair) battery is tied to hardware but warrants its own section Battery life leaves much to be desired, my daughter plays on apps and watches videos (too young to read yet) and the battery will last for ~4-5 hours, which is plenty if you are using it in the house but if you are going to be flying then it can fall a little short sometimes.<br /><br />-Kindle operating system (OS): (Excellent/poor):<br /><br />-- Part 1 [main system]: (poor) it doesn't run like anything that most people are used to. I have used and am very comfortable with both iOS (apple) and Android. the main idea with those is to have a few apps on the bottom with a library in the middle. the kindle makes it different where there are large &#34;recent history&#34; apps which side scroll in the middle. then on the bottom there is another row of &#34;favorites&#34; on the bottom. with a swipe up from the bottom tray you can access all of the apps you choose to have there, (like a hidden home screen). The search function is also mainly geared towards finding things on amazon and makes anything that is on the store come up first.<br /><br />--Part 2 [Free time]: (Excellent) this is the main reason i purchased the kindle, this way i could give it to my daughter and not have to worry about her getting into system files or getting into anything that sheshouldn't be seeing as well as making it easy for her to grow with the best parental controls offered without competition. This combined with an easily buyable foam case makes this by far the most toddler/child/kid friendly.<br />****one downside of free time that i have found; is that you cannot give the &#34;free time&#34; app access to your uploaded videos; i wanted to give my daughter access to some movies that i had on my computer, i uploaded them to the device but you can not give the freetime app access to those videos. i suppose it has to do with the fact that videos cannot be categorized so they don't give it access or if it is just overlooked because many people don't know how to directly upload videos to the devices.<br /><br />App store: (Fair): This is another possible weakness of the kindle; the reason being is that there are not as many apps available for the kindles as as the google play store or the apple app stores. One thing to note is that the kindle operating system is much newer than android and apple so this is normal. just like not that long ago there were more apps for apple than android, however today that is reversed. Currently there are not as many apps that i want to put for my daughter (kindle only has endless alphabet, where android and apple have all 3 endless alphabet, words, numbers)<br /><br />overview: I really like the kindle fire that I purchased, it is a great tablet that my daughter can grow into and use for years to come without me constantly looking over her shoulder or locking her in and out of specific apps (iOS guided access). There are many things that amazon can improve, however it is a great system for kids and for reading.<br /><br />*Caution; if you are looking for a tablet to organize your life with productivity/organization apps, i highly recommend you look some place else. the kindle is EXCELLENT for kids, and parental controls.",18-08-2015,1

Nothing is where you expect it to be. Nothing works like you expect it to. The UI feels like a too-tight sweater. Performance was awful. I was beginning to wonder if I had wasted my money.<br /><br />Then, my wife reminded me why I bought it: I wanted a bigger screen to read books and newspapers on. So I forced myself to use it for just that purpose.<br /><br />Got to say that when viewed from this perspective, it's a decent gadget. The UI makes sense (sort of) if all you're doing is reading a from a few sources all the time. I can see where Aunt Grace from Peoria would get the hang of it pretty quickly- and that's Amazon's true audience with this product.<br /><br />After seeing what it can't do, I'm wondering is one of the PaperWhite devices might have been a better deal as a pure reader- better display, better battery. Something I'd consider if I was buying again.<br /><br />Since I guess I'm stuck with my choice now, the big things I'd complain about are the glossy screen in bright light (hoping I can find a matte screen protector to remedy this), battery life (about a half-day of solid reading), and overall performance (forget about listening to Amazon music while reading).<br /><br />Summary: As long as you keep telling yourself it's a reader and not a full-up tablet, you'll be OK. If you're looking for a reader for Mom, Grandma, or Aunt Gracie, this might work. If you're looking for a full-up tablet, look elsewhere.

Two lengthy customer service phone calls since I got it in May! The old one was a gift in December 2012. I had used and loved the Kindle app on my iPod Touch for 3 years and was debating a Kindle Fire vs an iPad when a friend made the decision for me. I'm mostly a reader, with a few games and some Internet surfing, maybe a few old TV shows; I used it a lot and bought a LOT of book content because it was much easier to read on the Kindle than the Touch or my iPhone. Until 2.25 years in, this past spring, when the screen started flickering and then breaking up totally. I could not find a solution online and decided to buy a new Fire when it was on sale around Mother's Day. First problem: my books were not all showing in the Cloud. That was lengthy call #1 and included the CS rep saying that I would have to upload each book individually because some had updates (!). Today was lengthy call #2 because the Home icon opened to what looked like the App tab (but wasn't, because it included some books that hadn't been opened in months). That required a factory reset and again, hey, not all of my book content was showing in the Cloud! The CS pushed them out remotely. Not what's supposed to happen! I expect that this one will fail around the 2-year mark, too, and then I will be done with the Fire.",17-08-2015,0

It's an extraordinarily fast device for the price with a brilliant screen. I understood the limitations with the Amazon Marketplace and bought it anyway. However, Fire OS leaves a lot to be desired. This device will not screen cast to my Fire TV. I see no reason for this limitation. In fact, it will not allow Chromecast at all.So, I was going to give this a 3 star review. But if you install Fire OS 5.0, all that changes. You now have a nearly basic Lollipop experience. Did Amazon give up on the Fire OS Carousel? I don't know. All I know is I can have wallpapers and widgets again. You can even install launchers and any google apps. I can now use Chromecast with Netflix. I still can't cast Amazon Prime Instant Videos. I can even install side load play store apps.<br /><br />There is only one con and that is the keyboard. It is very slow to respond. Takes a few seconds to load. Then even when it is displayed, it is isn't done loading so I often type 3 letters that never show up. I finish typing and wait a few more seconds for the letters to catch up to my typing. But since I am missing the first 3, I have to start over again. If you use this as media device, this is not an issue. But if you do light forum discussions as I do, then it is too distracting for my tablet browsing experience. I have confirmed this behavior on 3 other Fird HD 7's owned by my family so it isn't limited to my device. I noticed the issue with all Fire OS 4.x thus far.

It was the only thing I wanted on prime day. It is still all the limitations of an amazon tablet vs a regular tablet -- including the REALLY annoying aspect of going through the internet to use youtube when obviously an app would be a lot easier and less temper-tantrum-throwing on amazon's part. It also feels a bit cheap--plastic-y and a bit of bulk and girth for being so hollow seeming inside. It has some bugs--it tends to freeze up quickly, and it tends to get really confused during high-demand apps like netflix and I've had to power it down and restart it a couple times already because of this issue. I have to completely get out of the program before turning the screen off to fix this.<br /><br />But for $100, it has a lot of memory and space, it saved the day when I needed something else with internet access when the wireless card on my laptop went out, and I use amazon frequently since I have prime so I have access to the shows, and the music, and all of that jazz. I also like having it small enough to shove in my purse or bag to take with me. I do want a bigger tablet eventually, but this is perfect for pulling up a recipe I need to cook with from online, or plugging into the stereo to play music while I do things around the house. It's a great little tablet, if you can get over the amazon-only limitations. A lot of people can't, which is understandable.... but hey, I have a smart phone, and a laptop, and between those two things I can deal with it. Also it DOES support netflix, which is the other really big thing I use it for.<br /><br />Having prime? I think for $100 this tablet is worth it.

I had the feeling something was inherently wrong with the Kindles shortly after my family started using them, one of them started freezing, then another one started doing the same shortly after that.  I know technology is fickle, but I would expect them to last longer than a year and a half since I paid Amazon nearly $600.00 total including covers for each.  On top of this, I bought my Samsung 10.1 tablet in November of 2012 (from BJ's Wholesale Club, of all places) and it's still working perfectly.

I decided to pick one of these up on Prime Day.

Looks great, pretty light, good display and has great specs for the price. Here is my issue. It is the same reason I prefer Android over IOS or PC over Mac or a Chromebook. I hate not having options. Because this is an Amazon product everything goes through Amazon. It's like everything on a chromebook is ran through Google services; without other options. I have to use the browser on it which is called Silk which I wouldn't mind but I can't import any bookmarks or anything from my phone or PC. You have to use the Amazon app store. It doesn't have a lot of things that the google store has but you can't get the Google play store. No issues with Amazon or this tablet I just didn't do my research. The point is if you want or need to be able to access your accounts from google or Microsoft (you can check email), documents whatever on your PC, any non-fire phone, Mac, chromebook whatever this isn't for you.

This tablet also does not have google play store built in and it runs on android. I would have kept this tablet for watching movies, playing clash of clans, and probably for reading E books but I didn't have the money. I also own a Microsoft surface 2 which I already use for watching Netflix and it has a bigger screen than this one. The kindle was overall pretty cool just don't buy the white version, and be warned that advertisements will appear on the locked screen.

I thought Amazon was ''the one''. I  decided to commit and became a prime member. Me and Amazon together forever.  So when Amazon decided to have a day dedicated to me- its prime member-I felt obliged to reciprocate by purchasing a Fire HD. My IPad Mini had recently left me a widow, so the timing was perfect. It was meant to be.  Finally, my new late night reading companion arrived.  Well, you can imagine my horror when I charged it up, turned it on, and some buxom babe advertising a game app popped up on my screen.  Amazon knew I would not want this constant reminder of my beloved's two-timing ways, and offered to discontinue this advertising affair for an extortion fee of $15. I felt so used. But what's a girl to do? Obviously, I was never special. No doubt there were signs (and small print) that I missed. But love can be blind. Yes, our relationship has continued.

Come August 1st, they still hadn't shipped it yet so I waited a few days before notifying Amazon. When I fianlly did, they notified me they were out of stock until the 10th of August. I was very excited to get my kindle, but I understood that they had a high demand for it. I love Amazon and the Amazon experience, so I wanted a Kindle Fire since I already had a Kindle Paperwhite. I wanted a tablet that was fully compatible with Amazon (such as Amazon instant video, audio books, etc.,) and also a tablet in which I can do the same things that I do on my android phone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that Amazon is very limited in the apps available for download. There is also not much customization available. These two things were a big downfall for me to be honest. The camera also isn't that good, which I already knew prior to buying it but I didn't mind.  The special offers on the lock screen bother me and I have tried to remove them, but there is no option to. Another small issue is typing; it is very with the cursor when I need to retype something. Ultimately, the kindle Fire HD 7 runs pretty smooth, has a nice screen resolution, and the volume is surprisingly loud. It is a good price for a tablet, but if I would have known the apps and customization are limited, I would have preferred a Galaxy. The other issue is that I would like to be able to access all of my Amazon apps from it as well, so I feel like I can't really win either way.",14-08-2015,0

I don't want anyone to read this review and think I'm not happy with my tablet.  Two of my three complaints are my fault for not paying closer attention to the product specs.  I'm very happy with it except for a few things.<br />  I am such a huge amazon fan that I almost feel guilty about pointing out, what I see as a few 'challenges' for the Fire HD 7.<br />There were a few things I was a little disappointed with on my new Fire HD 7.  The first two are really my fault for not paying closer attention to the product specs when I ordered it.<br />  First, there is no flash for the camera!  The first night I got it I wanted to check out the camera and I had to turn every light in the house on to even get the pictures to show up.  Forget about taking a picture with it outside anytime after dusk.<br />  Secondly, I didn't realize when I purchased it that you can't access the internet using your phone provider.  So when I'm on a road trip and my husband is driving I can only view or read what I have downloaded to the devise and can't access the internet.  This drives me crazy.<br />  The other thing that is really strange is that when you are reading books, and only when you're reading books, you can't place two fingers on the screen and expand the size of the text.  You can expand it by tapping the screen three times and it does expand the text,...once....so you have no control.  There's only one text expansion size on the Kindle Books.  And to make it even worse, when you do expand the text, it doesn't fit inside the screen!!!! And yes I've turned it horizontally and it still won't fit all the text inside the screen.<br />  I seems like the Fire HD 7's big brothers do have at least two of the features I feel are missing from this one.  It might be that my daughter will end up with my Fire HD 7 and I'll end up getting one of the larger (and more expensive) Fire Tablets.<br />  As I mentioned, my first two complaintsare listed in the product description and I guess I just missed them.

No searching for them. I also like the new arrangement of the sidebar Search, Home, Back Arrow. The new placement of where the charger plugs in is much more convenient. Depending on how you hold the tablet, the charger cord will either be on the right or the  top of the tablet. I definitely did not like having the charger at the bottom.

Couldn't even take a picture because it said my memory was insufficient.  I bought 16gb on my first kindle, and 16gb on this kindle.  I probably have less stuff stored than any other single individual worldwide, yet I couldn't even take a picture.  I should be able to have 20 books, a couple of games, a few pics and my email programs work without getting error messages.  Oh, 'updated' gmail inbox doesn't show how to delete messages en masse.  When I called about that, the tech couldn't tell me to simply press the 'edit' link at top of page to reveal the checkboxes on left margin to make this happen!  Good Grief!  Luckily, I got an answer when I googled the problem.  Bought this upgraded kindle solely for the rear-facing camera, so I could do videos at sporting events.  Lets see if that can happen without a problem.  If so, I'll update this review.  PS:  hows about ya send a basic &#34;step one&#34; &#34;step two&#34; list that ANY level of user can get full benefit from their electronic device from amazon.  I still don't know how to stream a Netflix video (to anywhere).  I also tried to watch Bosch a few months back, thinking it was free. . . because it said it was free to prime members.

The first few days it worked alright, it was a little slow when I did anything besides reading books, even checking my email.  I knew I would only be able to download apps from the Amazon store but as I had never used it before I was unaware how limited it was.  After 5 days (Yes, 5!!!) the screen became stuck on landscape mode.  I tried everything I could think of to fix it but nothing helped so I finally contacted customer service.  After repeating everything I'd already done (turning screen rotation on & off and turning the device on and off) they told me we would have to do a factory reset.  I attempted to do the factory reset while still on the phone with customer service and the screen just froze on the loading screen.  After waiting several minutes the customer service rep said he had done everything he could and they would send me a replacement.  I received the replacement quickly but this one only worked for one day before messing up in a completely different way.  The screen partially froze, I could click on some things but pretty much nothing reacted .  I couldn't open or close anything at all.  I couldn't even get the device to shut off!  After setting the device down and leaving it for about 20 minutes to talk to someone from customer service again I came back to find the bottom half of the screen completely black.  You could still see the image on the top half of the device but the bottom half was all black.  At that point I decided to return the device and not try a 3rd time.<br /><br />I am aware that these things happen sometimes with devices (odd that it happened to 2 of mine) so I am not giving it a 1 star.

Lack of a mini SD slot.  The 8GB internal memory is more than enough for my use but compared other two that had limited 1gb of internal memory that filled up quickly even though you could move some of the apps to the miniSD.

Another big problem I have is the amazon app store itself. Maybe having an android for years spoiled me because the google play store is by far superior, if you use play store or Apple app store then switching to amazon app store will drive you insane. Not only do they not have the games and apps I love and use, they bombard you with sub quality apps and games and  they all heavily utilize in game purchasing (maybe just the ones I checked out and possibly a problem with the phone game and app business in general but still upset me). The last big point I have to make is the lack of customization allowed. You basically can't customize anything, as I mentioned before the lock screen is always some ad amazon is throwing in your face, but the home screen also cannot be changed, just a black screen with your app icons there. I really wish, like my phone and my brothers tablet, you could add your own pictures or even change the app icons themselves, but alas I'm stuck with this sub par tablet. Anyways, sorry I rambled but I needed to get that all off my chest. Definitely going to get an Apple or Samsung next time.",12-08-2015,0

PRO - Amazon Prime and this thing are a GREAT combo. I have downloaded movies and TV shows for the plane, it is a good size to use on the plane or in an airport. Not bulky like a laptop, a little smaller than an iPad. great for the tray on the plane with enough room for your drink and peanuts(!). The fact that I get to download Prime Videos as part of my Prime membership is a huge plus. 2. PRO - Sound is good, I used them with a cheap set of earbuds, an average set of noise cancelling headphones and a great set of earbuds. Sound was good on all. 3. PRO - Picture/screen is better than I thought it would be. Video is crisp, no chop or stutter on playing video. 4. PRO - I bought the Amazon case with the fold back stand. Works very well, keeps the unit at a good viewing angle. Buttons and earphone jack are easily accessible. 5. PRO - Battery seems to be better than originally thought. Fully charged I can easily watch two movies on a plane trip if needed. Does nto lose its charge overnight all the time. 6. CON - It still seems to be a little flaky. I watched 2 episodes of Bosch (watch this Amazon Prime series!) on a flight, then changed planes. I closed the cover to sleep it and when I got on the next plane I had to hold the power button for about 30 seconds then power it back on. Will be calling Amazon about this when I get a chance. 7. CON - Just a little thing but sometimes the ads get in the way of the game play.  Overall I can give it a solid 3. If I get the flakiness worked out with the locking up (only thing I can call it), I would change it to 3 1/2. Worth the $99 I paid for it, not sure if I would pay $159 for it.  Well I finally grabbed a Kindle FireHD on Prime Day. I have 4 iPads, 2 Android tablets, and 1 Asus Win8 tablet, and a Surfacec Pro 3 tablet. I got the Fire for Plex and Amazon Prime. Received my Fire on Aug 4, could not use it until Aug 7.  My early thoughts are  - Meh. Not any kind of special tablet. I will list my pros and cons:  Pros Size is about right for a really portable tablet (not thickness, but width and height) Amazon prime gets to download movies/TV shows for offline viewing All (most) of my FireTV apps can be used, don't have to repay Sound is pretty good, slightly better than the iPad speaker. Have not tried with earphones yet, like I will be using on a plane Can read my Kindle books on it (Thats about it for pros, will update if I think of more)  Cons Weight - with the Amazon case it weighs just 4.3oz less than my full size iPad Air 2 with the Apple case, without case it is 5.2 oz less. Also uncomfortable holding in one hand to read Size - this thing is pretty thick. Hey Amazon, thin is in. Thickest tablet I own Battery life - not very good at all. Have had to recharge it every morning since I received it, it runs completely down overnight, despite having about 35% battery when I go to bed. If it continues I will contact Amazon support, as battery life is nothing like what is advertised. Slow - a very sluggish device. Not as bad as my other Android tablet but nowhere near what my iPad air is. Angry Birds took a full 55 seconds to load after a complete reboot. Not good. I am going on a couple of trips over the next few weeks and will be updating after I get back. Overall it is really a 2 1/2 star device but Amazon only allows whole stars. I spent 99 bucks on it so not really a huge deal, but for someone spending $159 for it (and STILL have to put up with the ads at that price) it will be a 1 star, in my opinion.",11-08-2015,0

I started out with the reader when they first came out.  A year later my husband bought me a Kindle Fire for Christmas.  It died in the hot tub (husband didn't see that it was sitting on the open cover) so I got it replaced with the warranty.  After that one my best friend got one and put it on my account so we can share our books (we like the same kind of books).  Recently I bought another one (this one) and gave my older one to my 10 year old grandson for his birthday.  He loves it as much as I love mine.  I log onto the local library and borrow books. I use it to go online and locate whatever I need. I use it to watch shows while I walk on my treadmill.  It uses Wifi only but you can find Wifi almost anywhere nowadays so it is rarely a problem.  I take my Kindle with me everywhere I go and don't know what I would do without it.,11-08-2015,1

So I tried calling and had someone on the phone right away. Unfortunately, this customer service experience was highly disappointing. I explained my issue and concern with the devices virus protection and was given a response that left me feeling responsible for the virus. He stated that the likely culprit was a web site I visited or an app I downloaded. Ultimately, they concluded that the only solution was reset to factory defaults. Meaning the device is wiped and I'm left to set it up again. No apology or suggestions on how to prevent this were offered.

Worked great in any light and especially well on the beach or by the pool.  Just needed a small book light to read the Touch in bed at night.  The Fire solved the reading in the dark problem as the backlit screen brightness could easily be adjusted.  For all other reading environments, however, the Fire just wasn't as good as the Touch and glare is a big problem (unless you buy an add-on screen cover which I haven't yet tried because it's annoying that you have to pay for all these add-ons (including the Fire cover)).

I was constantly having to adjust volume. Amazons answer: bluetooth headphones with microphones aren't compatible with the new kindle fire. That's all that exists.

I thought that since this was an Android device, I would be able to access FlashPlayer and be able to stream some online things that I like, as well as view an electronic magazine that I had subscribed to specifically because I got this device.  No Flash, so why did I waste $20 on the magazine subscription?  I'm trying to log in through my service, and it won't verify my e-mail/password combo, although I can access the magazine through my MacBook.  WTF.  Not really happy with the slowness of the operating system when it comes to apps.  Also don't like that I can't download Instagram.  The quality of video is not great on the screen either.  Really HATED the special offers, which was forcing me to watch commercials every time I unlocked the bloody screen.  Paid $15 more to get rid of that.  Just be honest, Amazon, and don't bother with the fricken' &#34;special offer&#34; price.  I also don't like that I can't seem to download a regular Google e-mail for my work e-mail, and so I'm forced to see ads while I'm trying to stay in touch with the office in my off hours.  Having said that, the Kindle function itself is fine most of the time.  Not sure if it's the device or Overdrive through my local library, but once I get halfway through a loaned eBook, I start having problems with missing the first page of a chapter.  What's up with that?  So now - all things considered.  If this thing takes a dive, I will simply save my money longer and buy an iPad, because this operating system is for the birds.  We've got two Mac desktop computers and two Mac laptops, as well as iPhones.  Believing that Flash would be included on this Android device was the only real selling point for me.  Because it's a good reader, it's not a total loss, so to sum up - meh.  And this was after reading and rereading reviews, and considering the purchase for months.",09-08-2015,0

I got a fire he in 2012 while that one is slightly bigger and just a hair higher in weight the beveled edges make a great way to hold the device while reading. This new one was 100.00 for prime day so I got one. I was planning on giving the old one to my daughter for her movies and I keep the new one. Well it's bulky and thick there is no bevel its likely a strain holding it while reading. It bugs me why they couldn't keep the same casing for the device, it's like they crammed the technology thicker rather than a couple of mm longer. Now I have no problems with the 2012 version. Isn't newer supposed to be better? I can't believe Amazon designers for the fire HD 2014 7 inch version would miss such a detail. Maybe it's something I'll become accustomed to and yes books are thicker but they bend and conform to hands. Anyone else a reader here. What do you think about the thickness. My I pad isn't this thick. I don't want a hand strap I already found a nice over I like. Sometimes I profit on a pillow but I'll shift positions and still like to hold the kindle to read. I could do so for hours with the other version. I haven't read a lot yet with this thick behemoth so the verdict isn't out yet totally if it's a bust, but surely others like the older models version of the casing shape. Keep in mind the cases for both are same thickness it's the edgi g that makes it less easy to ergonomically hold you need more thumb pressure to counter the thicker non beveled device where the older version counterbalance nicely between the fingers. Even nicer with the case on but I took the comparison photos with naked kindles for side by side look",08-08-2015,0

Because I got it at half price on the otherwise not-so-great &#34;black friday in July&#34; day, it's okay.  I would be pretty bummed if I bought this at full price. Basically I have a list of complaints!  It loses charge VERY quickly, and I'm only on it when I take a break (so 10 minutes at a time).  The power cord has already quit working, I have only had this two weeks. There is nothing on the outside of the cord to indicate that it was damaged at home in any way. Because Amazon and Google do not play well together, you cannot get the Google PlayStore on the Fire unless you look up how to hack it on youtube (which will apparently void any warranty).  I have to force stop/ restart several apps that come from the Amazon appstore, I don't know if this is the Fire or the apps themselves.  It does not pick up my wifi on my deck, where every other android device we own has a strong signal, so that's definitely the Fire.<br />To put this in perspective, I bought this at half price for ~$80.  Because I didn't trust my kids to handle an expensive tablet, I bought them some waaay off-brand tablets at Big Lots for $20 each.  Their tablets can do everything the Kindle Fire can do, and then some.  They're also several years old at this point, hold a charge, pick up wifi, and have BOTH the Amazon appstore and Google Play.

It arrived yesterday and other than a little trouble getting the right Amazon account - between mine and my son's - on the account for that Fire - he had a ball with it.  Well, he and his Grandma got together with their respective Fire and HP tablets and have decided that the heavier, bigger 8&#34; HP is better for my son, and the Fire HD 7&#34; tablet is better for his Grandma who has arthritic thumbs, because it's lighter and slimmer so it's easier for her to maneuver.

It's cute, light, the color is great, I even prefer the official amazon case to the official iPad case for my iPad 4. That being said.....this tablet is utter garbage.  The UI doesn't bother me, I can configure it the way I want with &#34;collections&#34; and the like.  The screen is bright and of good quality, and the Dolby speakers really do sound great, better than my iPad.  However, the compliments end here.<br /><br />What grinds my gears about this tablet:<br /><br />- Buggy as hell.  From apps not updating or loading properly to magazines loading and then disappearing, this OS is FULL of bugs that &#34;updates&#34; do not seem to solve.  I have had to delete, de-register, and restore this tablet FOUR TIMES since purchasing it last November, and Amazon has had to send me a replacement because the original device would not allow me to add my Gmail no matter what I tried.<br />- Instant Video:  For the past month I get a &#34;license error&#34; every time I try to play an instant video, and I am a prime member and have been since 2010.  Isn't the whole point behind this amazon tablet is so it can play amazon content?  I've given up trying to fix it and use Netflix instead, as the customer service is outsourced and completely inept.<br />- Lack of customization:  Not being able to add a background image to the home screen is a colossal error.<br />- Lack of Google Play Services:  Speaking of colossal mistakes, not including google play on this device is a HUGE mistake.  Whatever the reason is, get over it and include Google.  Not being able to have chrome, gmail, etc is just plain dumb and cripples an already crippled device.<br />- Lack of apps: another well discussed subject.  The major ones are here, but many are not, as discussed above.<br /><br />All in all very much a half baked device that could have been a lot better.",07-08-2015,0

My Kindle Voyage is my fourth kindle e-reader.<br /><br />I bought the kindle fire hd 7 when they had the sale going on. I wanted to try it. I'm glad it's not my only tablet device. I bought it because of the price and to keep in my desk at work so I could read on my lunch or do other things. I wasn't expecting much but thought that since the e-readers I have bought are by far to any other e-reader I've tried I thought I might be missing something with the fire. I'm not.<br /><br />My pros for this are:<br />Cost, couldn't beat the price.<br /><br />Native Kindle books app, it works much better than the ones on iOS devices and android devices.<br /><br />Exterior size, fits in my hand nicely and tucks away nicely in my drawer.<br /><br />My cons are:<br /><br />Screen is smaller than I thought it would be. A lot of wasted space around the sides of the screen.<br /><br />Battery life is HORRIBLE. I've mostly read on it and the battery drains way too fast. It went from 100% charge to 55% charge after reading on it for two hours with the book settings to black background and white lettering. No video watching, no excessive browsing of websites or usage of apps. Just reading.<br /><br />Seems to have a little light bleed around the edges. Not much but it is there.<br /><br />Weight, it's much heavier than I thought it would be. It feels about as heavy as my Samsung tab pro 10.1.<br /><br />I'm not saying don't buy it, but be ready for some drawbacks. It may be just what you're looking for. For me it will just be a device I use at work to read on for some of my lunch break. Not my favorite device bu far but it should function for what I want it to.",07-08-2015,0

I've never used any android type device so I was worried that it would be difficult to use. But it wasn't! The various screens and menus take a bit of time to get used to, but the learning curve isn't that difficult.<br /><br />The build of the kindle is quite sturdy. While it is made of plastic, it definitely feels more durable than an other tablets. I'm not afraid to take it outdoors. There are tons of apps available in the amazon app store as well - all the social networking apps and popular games are there. The performance is great, apps run well and the integration with my amazon account is great, especially as a prime member it is easy to access and download digital content.<br /><br />The reason the kindle loses a star: battery life and responsiveness. I've found that the kindle sometimes doesn't hold a charge for long periods of time when not in use. A minor detail, but worth noting. On some of the interfaces as well, there is a bit of lag time between when I touch and when the device responds. It is still fairly quick, but it is noticeable. This isn't always a problem though.<br /><br />Overall, especially for the price, I think the Kindle Fire HD 7 is a great entry-level tablet!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",07-08-2015,1

The screen for watching videos is crisper and there is faster processing for streaming so less pixelation.  I like that there is a synopses of each book attached to the ebook.  However, I owned a previous iteration of the Kindle Fire and I actually liked it better.  It was less sensitive to screen rotation.  This version freaks out quickly and cant decided which rotation to use if you are laying down reading.  The older version would go to sleep and easily waken when you touched the screen.  This version goes blank and wont waken.  It either requires a reboot or closing and opening the book cover to bring up the wake screen.  The back arrow doesnt always go back - it sometimes seems to catch and freeze.  The remove from carousel or device in this version requires an additional step which I found annoying after never having two steps in the previous version.  The advertisements are incredibly annoying to have to swipe off.  There isnt an option to turn them off but as a PRIME customer I feel this is complete overkill.  Usually the advertisements are not for products Im interested in and will not be purchasing.  Im in my Amazon account weekly so if I must receive advertisements, wouldnt it make sense to target what I purchase?

By way of context, I have numerous Kindles of many flavors, including 2 Fires (2nd gen HD), and the original Fire.  I had the HDX in the house, and returned it.  I waited to purchase this one, since I didn't really 'need' it.  This is a beautiful device.  As far as features:  Sound:  I was concerned about speaker placement when I saw that they were at the bottom (when in Amazon's case).  I was hoping for higher volume and better sound than on my previous Fires, and this device delivers both.  The volume is high enough that it doesn't need external speakers (which I typically use when using my older devices).  Placed in the Amazon stand up case, even though the speakers are at the bottom, the sound is great.  Reading:  Great screen.  I was worried about the 'purple haze' that appeared around the screen edge of the HDX (the reason for my return).  There is none. This is also a great reader if you prefer a backlit screen.  Speed:  The difference in speed is noticeable.  Everything seems to happen faster:  from navigating the carousel, switching or loading apps, accessing on line sites, etc.  It's great.  Functionality: There is also added functionality which is helpful when using the device.  This may be added to older devices via a software update, but to date I haven't seen them.  (Think of the functionality as 'assists' when on different screens which are nice to have).  Movies:  I haven't watched any video yet, but will do so, and update this review in a few days.  Memory:  Buy the 16G.  There is preloaded system/app stuff that takes up some of your space (although from first glance, it appears like there is less pre-used space than on my older devices).  I purchased my original Fire with 8G, and ran out very quickly.  The 16G is worth the extra money.  Also, if you are a Prime member, take advantage of your Prime offerings which take up space if loaded onto your device.  It will save you space.  The standup case:  Isfine.  I love my Origami cases for my old Fires, and was sorry that this one was not an Origami case, but it's fine.  It stands straight in both portrait and landscape mode.  Amazing specs for the price!  The device has been going on sale regularly, so if you watch it, you should be able to catch it at a reduced price.  (A tip:  If you put it in your cart, save it for later, then check your cart daily, it will show any discounts on items which you've 'saved for later'.)  I wouldn't hesitate to buy it!

When I bought the device, it was because of the Amazon Prime Day sale so I got stuck with 8MB model (the higher memory device was sold out).  There is a feature (I didn't know about when I purchased) on the Fire that makes more memory desirable:  you can download prime videos to watch at a later date offline.  This is GREAT for car trips where I want my children to watch videos without eating up mobile hotspot cellular data.  With an 8MB model, however, the amount of material than can be stored for offline viewing is limited.  Another huge limitation is being stuck with the Amazon app store and no Google Apps.  BUT, I have learned a great deal about &#34;side loading&#34; apps and this makes the Fire much more useful. (Google &#34;Sideloading Kindle Fire HD&#34;)  The display is great for reading books.  This is a wonderful device for World of Tanks Blitz (which must be side loaded) with amazing graphic detail.  This is a great product for the value (remember, I bought during Prime Day sale).

The advertisements truly are non-intrusive, so all but the most ad-averse probably don't need to spring for the extra money to get rid of them. I'm not giving it five stars due to two drawbacks that really irk me -- the first is the limited number of downloadable options on Amazon Prime. The second drawback is that this can't be connected to a TV, at least not without WiFi (and the specific reason I bought this was for watching videos in a remote location where I don't have a WiFi connection -- in locations where I do have WiFi, there are already other entertainment options).

Special offers are ads on your fire hd, which I did not know about until the day I received it. I did not like how the interface looked, with the rather large Most Recent icons up top and the same icons at the bottom but in smaller size. I found it useless, cluttered, and a waste of space. I had no use for many of the pre-installed apps and features on the Fire HD 7, such as firefly, free time (meant as parental controls for children's use), the Help app, and contacts. Many apps from the app store are not able to be downloaded on the Fire HD, and a lot of the apps I have on my iPhone such as youtube and instagram don't exist for the Fire HD either. The camera isn't that great, in my opinion. It's not HD either. The iPhone and iPad cameras are top notch compared to Fire HD 7. The home screen and lock screen cannot be customized at all, in any shape or form. There is no option for wallpapers or to change the way it looks. The preset wallpaper slideshow on my lock screen freaked me out and gave me the heebie jeebies because they're macro photos (close to it) and photos of plants and nature, which I do not like. I rather have a picture of a cute dog from my camera roll as my wallpaper. (Cant do much with your photos but to upload them onto social networks and edit and print)<br />One thing I do like, is the emoticons in your keyboard. They're different than the emojis on an iPhone keyboard and are actually cute!<br />Overall, I didn't really like the Fire HD 7 as much as I thought I would. The device does not allow any customization whatsoever and includes lots of features (the ones that aren't listed on the description) and apps that I have no use for. The camera isn't HD as it says it is, it's not even close to hd. Nothing to be excited about honestly. I like my technology to be savvy, customizable, and minimal. I'm returning mine, but maybe the Fire is best suited for someone else with different needs?",31-07-2015,0

I spent a good deal of time trying to decide if I should get the plain HD or the HDX.  I even looked at the Paperwhite and the Voyage and I was tempted by the Voyage.  But I have owned a first generation Kindle Fire since 2011 and have loved it and I already own a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 for all those things for which you need a powerful tablet (that would be last year's birthday gift also purchased on Amazon).  So I compromised on the HD since I will use it primarily for reading.  I prefer the 7&#34; size for reading and the 10&#34; size for day-to-day tablet use but the 10&#34; is too big for my tastes for reading a book.  Buy at least the 16GB of memory and pay the fee to have no advertising.<br /><br />I had no trouble setting it up, frankly it couldn't have been easier, but I suspect that is because I am a long-time Kindle user and Amazon customer. I signed in and it was good to go. Then I re-registered my original Kindle to my husband and got him set up.  He is very tech-resistant and I tease him that the Kindle is the gateway drug to tablets.  I also told him I was not buying him any more physical books.  The original Kindle still works fine.  The primary reason I bought a new one for myself was to get him into an ereader.<br /><br />I do not find it to be much more fragile than the first gen model although it is lighter and trimmer.  But as with any technology, if you bounce it off the tile floor or the concrete driveway of course you will have a problem.  Get a good case.  (I have had several Fintie cases.  They are stylish, provide adequate protection and are well-priced so if you grow tired of it, it gets soiled or just wears out you can get another.  You can get them here.  See my reviews.  I have them on all my electronic devices.)<br /><br />I had temporary separation anxiety for my original Kindle but I got over it within a day after I discovered everything I was accustomed to in the interface was indeed still there but was improved, though organized slightly differently and more conveniently.  Best I can say is that the interface resembles the Kindle app for tablets and phones.  I like it better than the original.<br /><br />If you buy one remember this tip.....You're going to want to turn off the highlighting.  It's under &#34;View&#34;,  &#34;View Options&#34;, &#34;More Settings&#34;.  Amazon, this incredibly annoying feature should be off as default.

I purchased it for approximately $150 and used it almost 24/7 for almost 3 years.  I used it to play music, stream music, watch movies/shows, manage and edit photos and graphics, listen to audio books, participate in social media, send/read e-mail from 3 different accounts and even occasional read books.  I used it at the office, at the beach, in the car, in the woods and in every room of my home.  I have taken my Kindle EVERYWHERE - EVERYDAY.  I have dropped the Kindle, spilled beverages on the Kindle, tossed the Kindle around, sat/slept on the Kindle,  allowed small kids to use the kindle,  and once my cat puked on my Kindle.  My Kindle HD held up to all of the abuse and kept ticking.  I found the promotional ads easy to ignore.  The text to speech function for mobi documents has been a lifesaver - and is possibly my favorite feature.  Given how much I used the Kindle and how little I paid for it -- this was one of the most cost effective purchases of my lifetime. While there are probably other tablets that do more and do it better --- the Kindle HD is still an AMAZING value. The only cons were the lack of availability for some desired apps (Instagram) and the durability of the charging port.  My Kindle was originally purchased without a charger and that was an added cost.  Eventually, even with an official Kindle charger from Amazon the charging port wore out.  For the last 6 months it has become increasing difficult to get the Kindle to charge and to stay charged.  After consulting with very helpful Amazon tech support staff, my Kindle has been declared dead and I have ordered an new Kindle Fire HDX -- this time a 32g model to store more audio books and photos.",30-07-2015,1

I also like that I can download a movie to watch later and do not have to be connected to WIFI and stream everything.<br />However I don't like that of the 8 gigs only 5 are actually usable. You download a couple movies, a couple books, a few hundred songs and an app or 2 and that is it, you are told you are out of space. You can not uninstall anything that is preloaded so can only uninstall the things you downloaded yourself, 3 gigs are used up by the operating system. 5 are for your own use.<br />I am also not as impressed with the camera as some people seem to be. My cell phone takes better pictures and videos than this kindle fire.<br /><br />The picture is very sharp, and the sound is much better than I expected for a tablet this size, which makes it a great portable music player whether streaming music from prime or listening to what you have downloaded to the device.<br />The ads don't really bother me since they only appear when the tablet is sleeping or otherwise not in use. It is not like they pop up while you're reading a book or watching a movie.

After messing with this thing (help books are no help) for a full day I gave in and contacted Kindle Customer Service.  Was disconnected twice before I got to Teri (what a darling).  The problem was (and still is) that there is not a single thing you can do to mark or remove books from the main cloud listing once you have put them (a link only I think) into a collection.  You are left with a collection of similar books (or authors) and cloud listing of many, many books with no indication  that they have been previously included into a collection.  I had to pencil (yes I still have one) a list of each collection to check against my large cloud listing to determine if I had included everything into the collection of my choice. Needless to say, I am going book by book to locate the 10 or 12 I had saved for later reading.  I also know that any future purchases will be manually included into a collection as they are purchased. Why, oh why, can we not create cloud collections in the manage my content page on Amazon..com ?? Why can we not indicate beside each purchase which collection (if any) the book resides in.  I have done some programming and this does not present a major obstacle.  We already get several choice now,. why not one more and why not a column that contains the individual collection name of our choice.

Worse is the fact any content you own through Google Play Store is cannot be used on the Kindle Fire. Having been an Android phone user for years, I own a lot of content I can install and run on all of my Android devices except this one. It's a pretty cynical marketing ploy which makes the device feel less-than-premium. I understand the device is sold near or below cost with amazon looking to turn a profit thru sale of content, but i would much rather have had the option to pay a little more for the ability to use all my Android apps and content just like I paid more for the ad-free version.

It was never mishandled or dropped. It simply stopped working. These things are too inexpensive to warrant repair so that was the end of that. I told myself at the time I would not buy another, but my one year old iPad just malfunctioned! That's right. After a year, the headset receptacle failed, and it is more expensive to repair than it is to buy a Kindle Fire, so here I am again with a new one. For the money, it is fair to say the Kindle Fire is a reasonable purchase. I won't go into packaging and other factors that are irrelevant to watching media. Let me start by saying the icons and other information on the screen is way too small for me to read without a magnifying glass. Admittedly, my old eyes are not what they were, but really, this is an avoidable problem Amazon. The data on the screen should be easily readable even by me, by going to &#34;Settings.&#34; Except there is no &#34;Settings.&#34; Secondly, when you power on the device, a pop-up add appears. I didn't buy a Kindle Fire so I would be forced to look at adds for diapers and women's vaginal cream. I want to see a nice clean screen. The Amazon logo would be okay, or a view of mountain peaks perhaps... Thirdly, a list of  options is stretched across the top of the home screen in small print and below that, are a series of icons. This is not intuitive arrangement and does not flow cognitively. Come on Amazon, find a better means of presentation. I looked at the apps on the Kindle Fire, and it's apparent I'm not through with the iPad. Many of the apps on iPad are not available on the Kindle Fire even though they are free. All this being said, picture quality is very good, and so is sound quality, the two main factors is judging the value of device. I have Amazon Prime, a wonderful service offering countless free movies and TV shows, including Amazon exclusives like House of Cards, and I can find old black and white movies on Amazon too, not available on Netflix for instance, like In Harm's Way, with John Wayne. All in all, I give the Kindle Fire three stars. This will change however, if my current Kindle Fire dies as soon as the last one did.

Amazon should not assume ( you know what they say- assumptions makes an a--out of you and me)  that everyone is techno advanced and for those who aren't - well the so called manual leaves a lot to be desired.  First you need to go online to get to the manual- but there are no directions on how to get your device on line- I managed that and got to the short, not very helpful manual.  But here was my first big stumper- I wanted to send a message on Facebook but could not figure out how to make a space between words in my messages.  I examined the keyboard carefully, had my husband look at it, kept playing with it, could not figure it out. Read the short manual several times but there was not one word about spacing and not much else about the keyboard symbols and their use.  I thought I would search help- but guess what when my typing ran the words together in the search box it couldn't return any results.  During this process I found out that if you hit the mike symbol on the keyboard you can speak into the kindle and it tries to type your words into the box.  But it didn't do a good job of interpreting my words- more about that in a minute- and I had no luck finding my answer.  I tried going online and looking up the answer but no one seemed to have the right answer- at least for this model.  Finally- just by luck - I found out that to make a space between words when using the keyboard YOU TOUCH THE BLANK AREA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE KEYBOARD.  I guess thats much like a regular keyboard on a computer and maybe I'm dumb - but I was not the only person asking that question on line!<br /><br />Please Amazon revise your manual to briefly describe keyboard symbols and how to operate the keyboard.  In fact revise your whole manual so that even the person with the least tech skills can learn to use the Kindle fire easily.  For many people this low priced and - nice- device is their first  excursion to tablet type devices.  One more example - I want to learn how to use the 2 cameras- but there are no directions in the manual.<br /><br />Now back to the speech to text thing. Its barely mentioned in the manual - no tips on how to use it.  So how do you remove a word that isn't the word you spoke?  I spoke slowly and distinctly but still had errors.  I had to go out of mike mode back to typing- use the error key to remove the word - then back to mic mode - wasn't worth the effort.  I also turned off the suggested word and auto-correct features because they made a mess out of my texts.  Now I understand why some of my friends have such awful texts- if they use voice to text or let autocorrect &#34;help&#34; them.  You can turn off those things by going to apps, then keyboard( I think) .<br /><br />I still haven't figured out some things I think I can do on the device but I'll keep trying as the manual isn't very helpful.  The other thing I don't like I that the battery life is awful- a couple hours of use even with minimal internet use - on a full battery is all you will get.  And I followed the advice on extending battery life which is in the manual somewhere.  And when it charges the charger gets very hot- which worries me a bit.  And there's no light to let you know when its fully charged.<br /><br />Ok the nice things- the pictures are crisp- I bought this so I could see color photos and charts in things I read.  You can adjust the back lighting and even the background color. The screen is large enough for web browsing.  Its not much heavier than my kindle paper white and holds more data.  The silk web browser seems ok - I like goggle chrome- but I won't be on line much with the device anyway.  The sound is fairly good and being able to play music is a feature the old kindle didn't have. I have only had it a few days.  I think I will like it even more when I learn all the things I can do with the device and the price was great.

I also own a Lenovo tablet,"This is the third Kindle I've owned and I really like it. I also own a Lenovo tablet, so it's been interesting comparing the features/functions. I love how it has a backlight, so I can read it in the dark. Unfortunately that means that I had to sacrifice my wonderful matte screen, so it's much harder to read it in bright locations. That's not a major issue since I mostly use it at night. It's easy to install apps, although there's a limit to what apps can be installed (what do you mean I can't put Instagram on it?!) but the amazon store has a huge variety. I kind of like the carousal on the main screen, but find it a little annoying when I am switching between games, books, and music because it can get filled up pretty fast and then I have to scroll to find what I'm looking for. I tend to prefer to have the icons displayed on the screen so that I can quickly switch between items. I also wish they had a Home button because sometimes it's difficult to get the screen to cooperate when playing games. Overall, I really like this model and love the large screen.",28-07-2015,1

I have an Amazon Prime account and this is the worst thing I've ever purchased from them. I bought it as a gift for my wife and it only makes her upset. First, the zoom feature, which works on any other device I've used flawlessly, gets jammed up and won't zoom back out. Making the touchscreen keyboard malfunction and the content impossible to read. This was enough to bring her too tears while trying to reply to an email today. Second, the web browser is the worst and Amazon's lame appstore gives no options. The default internet web browser, Silk, will make your life hell if you want to surf the web. Slow, pages won't load, and strange errors that come and go until you give up. Third, is that the appstore is awful. The apps are all rated low, function poorly and are extremely limited. Even when there is a app with a name that you know, like YouTube, the logo is always weird and off and the app won't function as it should.

This time the device will no longer stay on, even when charged at 100%, the only way to use the device is to plug it into the charger, otherwise it just turns off and will not start back up.  I contacted Amazon once again about the issue, however they said it was outside the warranty (by 30 days) and they would give me a new one for the low price of 170 dollars (apparently a discount from what they said).  I declined however as I'm worried about spending more money on a device that fails often and will only last a year.

You can check my other reviews and note that I rate fairly and honestly and that I have been a faithful Amazon customer for many years. I had purchased a Kindle several years back when they were new and eBooks were just coming into vogue. I liked the device (though at the time I was disappointed that Kindle books were often more expensive than paperback versions) and quickly adapted to using it. Unfortunately the screen went berserk and that was the end of that. I continued to purchase Kindle books using my computer to read them because I had been converted to eBooks; however, that does not mean that I had been converted to Kindle devices. That experience with the Kindle device had soured me on Amazon's reader. I like dependable tools and that Kindle failed in that respect. Fast forward to last October and my mother-in-law's diagnosis with terminal brain cancer (she was soon restricted to hospital and nursing home care). To keep her involved in photos and videos of daily family life we purchased a Kindle Fire for her. It was a great way to share photos, books, etc. with her and the Fire performed well for her until she passed on three months later. My wife has used that Fire since then. Fast forward four months later to when my wife purchased a Fire for me even though I had declined purchasing one several times previously when they came on sale at Amazon. I had failed to tell her that I did not trust Amazon's electronic devices [sorry Amazon, great retailer as you are, I do not trust your Kindle devices). I have used it sparingly, mainly because I had become accustomed to using my PC to read Kindle books. The novelty of the reader was diminished because of my first experience with a Kindle reader. Fast forward two months to now: my Kindle Fire HD 7 will not turn on and will not charge. Yes, yes, I have tried every online Google-search remedy (and the charger works on the other Fire).NOTHING works. The magical 20 seconds, 30 seconds, press the On button after, before, and during charging. Wiggle the charging plug gently. Nada, zilch, zero, NOTHING. I even turned around three times with my eyes shut and spit three times. Anybody want an expensive flat paperweight? Anyhow, I have read the many complaints posted here about this device. I have also read the many complaints about Amazon's poor response and support for those many customers who have been maligned by Amazon via this device. I am going to contact Amazon about this. I will post the results. Meanwhile, I do not recommend that you purchase ANY Kindle device. This is not only because of my experience with this device, but because, like other products that I have purchased that are made in China, it is a roll of the dice to learn whether the item received is the result of good quality control or of poor quality control. I avoid Chinese products because I have found them to be unreliable (in one case, the item never arrived and neither did the replacement for it).  UPDATE:  Amazon responded very quickly--before I had the opportunity to call them! The day following my review Amazon contacted us and initiated forwarding another Fire.  I received the another Fire (thank you Amazon) and it is working well. Excellent service from Amazon!",28-07-2015,1

I'm still tempted to check with CS, as it seemed when I first got it had great sound, and now not so much!  Either that or my ears have gotten worse.  Perhaps it is defective.<br /><br />On to the first MAJOR discovery ... BACK UP & RESTORE!!  Had to do a factory reset on one of my Fire Tablets a year or so ago when an update crashed it.  Yes,  the reset DID get it to work again,  but I lost EVERYTHING, game levels I'd achieved, all my bookmarks, personal files etc.  Not happy.  Though I haven't yet gotten to use it,  this new fire does BACK-UPS! I might give a try before I add too much to it just for the heck of it. Maybe it will give me my sound back. I think this is HUGE.<br /><br />Major discovery NUMBER TWO ... I found this one just this AM. I'd noticed (but not paid much attention to) a little microphone icon that comes up on my keyboard.  This AM I thought I'd see what it does.  VOICE TO TEXT !  And it rocks!  Years ago I remember buying software for my computer that was supposed to do that, it did ... sort of.  It mangled the translations so bad that it took longer to fix it than to type it in the first place. Haven't used it a lot YET,  but this one is awesome.  Most of the translation is perfect other than you have to add caps, punctuation etc.  Far less to fix than UNcorrecting auto corrected text.  This is going to get a LOT of use. Seems to work on any program that accepts text input.  (I've tried 3 so far.)  Love it!

I love reading in bed without needing a light source.

There is also a free dimmer app to control the brightness automatically or you can use the manual controls on the Kindle) I also check my email and surf the web on it, watch prime videos (lots of free ones including TV shows, whole HBO series, movies) on it. My son uses his, also, mostly for reading books. This last one I got on Prime Day for my daughter who is going off to college.<br />I love the quality, it has never  let me down.<br />My only minor complaint on my older version was that the power button was hard to see-so I put a tiny dab of pink nail polish on it. But this newer version has a raised power button so it's not an issue.<br /> I have an apple computer and I have even bought an I-pad but I took it back. I really don't need it since I use my laptop at home, smart phone when I'm out. And for the price, the Kindle is just right for me and is so seamless with the free Prime offerings. (I was pleasantly surprised to learn that when I joined Prime, I could put up to 4 additional family members on my membership with me for free, so they get all the great perks of free shipping, free books, free videos etc. My parents absolutely love it)<br />If you are new to Kindle books, there is a free Kindle app you can put on your computer or phone so any book you are reading on your Kindle you can get it on your computer or phone, and it picks up where you left off, very cool.<br />It's great for travel; I take all my books on vacation and I can also watch the free videos that I  download before my trip while on the plane or in the car. You would need wi-fi to download new ones.<br />If you like free stuff like me, one more place to get free and/or very cheep kindle books is a website called  BookBub &#60;info@bookbub.com&#62;",26-07-2015,1

I actually enjoy the size of it and feel of it.  I also own an Ipad 2, which was my first purchase a few years ago, but that was actually cumbersome to carry around.  The fire feels to be the perfect blend of an Ipad and a smartphone, which is exactly what I wanted.  Now for the operating system, it feels clean and streamlined. I think for a novice, it would be simple to use, while complex enough to be modified by someone more experience.<br /><br />  There are a few things that upset me about the HD7.  First off, let me say I love personalizing the things I own.  The lock screen on the default OS is not customizable if you wish not to root(a.k.a break into the operating system and load your own... possible to brick/break it also) your tablet.  The default lockscreen also displays ads to you.  Now this isn't a game breaker as this is a lockscreen, but I would have expected it to be changeable.  Another thing was when I started using it, I would have my battery drain in sleep mode.  I was able to fix that problem by googling battery drain for the HD7, but if you are like me.. you won't always have a charger nearby.. (sidenote: The battery life is great since the drain has been resolved)<br /><br />  Overall I am glad I purchased the Fire HD7.  At ~$140 I was wary to spend that on another tablet, but I felt the Primeday discount made it hard to pass up.  For what it's worth.. if I had to buy this again, even at full price, I wouldn't mind it one bit.",26-07-2015,1

I currently use a Nexus 7, and I'm going to continue using it. The Fire HD is cheap, flimsy and continuously locks up, but that's not the worst thing about it. Amazon has gone to great lengths with the Fire to keep you constrained within the Amazon family of apps. I use the Chrome browser across all my devices. To use Chrome on my Fire I had to go online to find out how. Then I had to install 3rd party software on the  Fire, and install Chrome using that software. I acquire most of my apps from the Play store, and while there is probably some way to install the Play store app on the Fire, I didn't bother to discover it because I've given up on the Fire HD.<br /><br />I bought Amazon's product, and they expressed their gratitude by trying to put me in a virtual prison cell. They've created a product that attempts to restrict you to &#34;Amazon approved&#34; products. I'm sorry, but I wanted a tablet not a parent. When I bought my Nexus two years ago it came with the Google apps preinstalled. No attempt was made to restrict me to Google apps. I'm free to install any Android OS app from any source. I'm so irritated by my experience with the Fire HD that it's actually tarnished my opinion of Google, since the Fire OS is a proprietary version of the Android OS.<br /><br />If you are considering purchasing a Fire HD, or any Fire product, don't do it. Spend a pittance more and get the Nexus 7. Mine is about two years old and still serving me well. I use it everyday, including for reading books I buy through the Kindle app. See what I mean? My Nexus hasn't tried to restrict me to the Play Books app.<br /><br />SHAME ON AMAZON! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!",25-07-2015,0

I will keep trying to check it but it may have to be returned.  Other than the battery issue there is the silly promo material that constantly appears which only makes you angry and not included to buy particularly since being a prime member you would think Amazon would do better by their membership.

My last Kindle Fire HD crashed and crashed hard (it took 12 hours to charge, wouldn't hold a charge, then eventually wouldn't turn on). I debated for about a month which kindle I was going to get. I almost got the Voyage but I am super glad I decided to go with this one. The battery lasts day (even when I read for hours at a time everyday). The display is crisp and I love the option of the color backs. A+ kindle! Would definitely recommend.",25-07-2015,1
